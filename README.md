## Project Overview

Celestial-Body-Simulation is an evolving Unity project designed to demonstrate the power of the Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) framework. This simulation strives to offer a realistic portrayal of celestial bodies, integrating various planetary forces like gravitational, centrifugal, and Coriolis forces. Additionally, precise torque calculations simulate the rotational effects on individual celestial objects. The project is optimized for superior performance and efficient entity management, capable of seamlessly handling over 250,000 independently interacting celestial entities.

## Key Features

- **DOTS Framework Integration**: Harness the full potential of Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack for optimized performance and efficient entity management.

- **Planetary Forces Simulation**: Realistically model gravitational, centrifugal, and Coriolis forces for accurate interactions between celestial bodies.

- **Torque Simulation**: Accurately represent rotational effects through torque calculations on individual celestial objects.

- **Scalability**: Showcase the project's prowess in handling a large number (250,000+) of independent entities, demonstrating scalability and outstanding performance.

## Planned Features

- **Planetal Rotation**: Introduce planetary rotation around a single source within the simulation to add complexity and enhance visual appeal.

- **Improved Randomization**: Enhance the randomization setup with more customization options for users to fine-tune simulations.

- **Optical Differences**: Implement visual identification enhancements for planets, providing a more nuanced representation of the values each planet holds. Move beyond a simple glowing sphere to improve user understanding.

- **Save Parameters**: Implement the ability to copy/save your favorite simulations for convenience.

## Important Notes

- **Realism Considerations**: While the project aims for realism, certain values are adjusted for feasibility within the Unity environment. Future iterations plan to address these tweaks to achieve a more authentic simulation.

- **Randomization**: Due to the current randomization, it's advisable to select different seeds or tweak parameters to prevent the simulation from "nuking" all celestial objects. Some scenarios may lead to planets having no rotation or being too close together, resulting in gravitational forces causing a cascade effect. Adjust parameters accordingly to avoid unintended outcomes.
